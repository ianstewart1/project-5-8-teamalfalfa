# GRADE: 63/64 

_Well done!_

## Functional and implementation requirements: 34/36 points total

Earned|Possible|Requirement | Comments
------|--------|------------|----------
1|1| Add two new menu items to the Edit menu called Group and Ungroup.
4|4| When the Group menu item is chosen, all selected note bars are grouped into one gesture. A gesture behaves as if it is just one note bar with a complex sound to it.  If nothing is selected when the Group menu item is chosen, nothing happens.
2|2| Selecting any note in a gesture causes the same thing to happen to all the others in the gesture.
2|2| Unselecting any note in a gesture with control-click causes the same thing to happen to all the others in the gesture.
2|2| Drag-selecting over a gesture consistently selects or unselects all the notes in the gesture.
2|4| Dragging note bars in a gesture moves or stretches all notes in the gesture. |_I'm unable to stretch notes within a gesture, but I gave you points for the "stretch goal" below._
3|3| Gestures are indicated visually by a thin black dotted line around the group of note bars. 
1|1| A selected gesture is indicated using a style similar to that of a selected note bar.
4|4| Gestures can include note bars or other gestures (that is, gestures can be nested).
4|4| When the Ungroup menu item is chosen, the selected gesture is ungrouped. Note that nested inner gestures are not ungrouped; you have to ungroup the nested gestures separately after ungrouping the outer gesture.  If no groups are selected when Ungroup is chosen, nothing happens.
1|1| After selecting the Group menu item, the new gesture becomes the only selected item. 
2|2| After choosing Ungroup, all the inner notebars and gestures of the ungrouped gesture are selected.

### "Stretch goal" - 2 points

2|0| When the right edge of a gesture is grabbed and stretched left or right, the duration and offset of everything in the gesture should stretch proportionally.

2|2| The release is tagged as project-5-release.

## Reflection - 11.5/12 points

For project 5 and beyond, I will expect your discussion of design and elegance to refer explicitly to design principles we have discussed in class.

## Elegance - 16/16 points

I looked at your UML diagram to assess the elegance of your class design.  You will get a grade for class design starting with Project 6.
I spot-checked a new class (Gesture) and a modified class (TuneComposer) to assess method-level design and self-explanatory code.

Earned|Possible|Requirement | Comments
------|--------|------------|----------
0|0| Class design | _Reconsider the contents of the Playable interface with an eye towards the SOLID principles. It's also surprising that an interface named Playable has no method play()!_ _See also GitHub Issues._
8|8| Method design | _Looks good. Most of my concerns were at the class design level, not the method design level._
8|8| Self-explanatory code | _I asked for Javadoc on the ```Playable``` interface, but that is not one of the two classes I listed above._
